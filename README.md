# Disimagerv2
A reverse image searching Discord bot for calling out art thieves and other immoral liars.

## Why?
You see them everywhere- these weird internet freaks who steal someone's art and pass it off as their own! Or catfishes. Or just bad people who like to tell lies.
No more! Disimager does the work for you. It's intelligent and knows how to work with every form of image in Discord- those directly uploaded and those embedded via link.

## Setup
Just go into config.ini and set your token there. Change the prefix if you want (default `$`). Then invite it (the bot will give you the invite link when it's ready) and run it, all done!
## Usage
`$imgsearch link`
Whereas "link" can be a direct image link, or a link to a Discord message containing a directly uploaded or embedded image.
You can also redact the link entirely if you are slapping the command onto an image you are uploading. The bot knows.
